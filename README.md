# Maze Solver Project 🧠🔍

## 🚀 Overview
The **Maze Solver** is an interactive application designed for efficiently solving mazes using advanced algorithms. Upload a maze image 🧩, set your start and end points, and let the algorithms work their magic.

## 🛠 Key Features
- **Algorithms Included:**
  - 🌐 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A systematic explorer.
  - 🕵️ **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A thorough pathfinder.
  - 🧠 **A-Star Algorithm (Astar)**: A heuristic-based genius.
  - 🚀 **Bidirectional Search**: An efficient, two-way approach.
  
- **User-Friendly GUI**: 
  - Upload PNG maze images.
  - Easily select your start ('A') and end ('B') points.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
Before running the app, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Pillow (PIL)**: For handling image operations. 🖼️
  - Install using: `pip install pillow`
  
- **Tkinter**: Built-in for creating the GUI.
  
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing tasks. 🕶️
  - Install using: `pip install opencv-python`
  
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations and arrays. 🔢
  - Install using: `pip install numpy`

## 🕹️ How It Works
- **Choose Your Maze:**
  - Pick a `.png` image with a white background and ensure it's cropped to fill the frame.

- **Run the Application:**
  - Start the app by running `MainApp.py`.

- **Upload & Set Points:**
  - Upload your maze, then click to select the start and end points.

- **Watch the Process:**
  - The algorithm will visualize the solution on the maze. Feel free to try different algorithms!

- **Restart with a New Maze:**
  - Close the current maze and start fresh using **Open Image Maze Solver**.
